Compare two poker hands and determine the winner.

If both hands have the same category ( two straight, two flush, two three of kind, etc..) then the output message will be "high card" because the tie breaking rule is based on higher card.
If both hands have different categories, the winning category will be in the output message.

Black must always be the first hand and white the second.
